            My name isn't actually Lukas, but that's who I like to be referred to as!<br>
            I can do HTML, CSS and JS + jQuery.<br>
            I also dabble in python from time to time.<br>
            Please note that I'm not great in any programming languages, and often need to give myself
            a refresher on how things work.
